Test for SysMech

I have used JAXB for creation of the java classes from the supplied XSD file.

The topology provided I have split into two files ENTITIES & ASOCIATIONS

These XML files are then unmarshalled passing details into Arrays.

These arrays are passed into the method which implements the Breadth First Search (BSF) alogorithm to
determine the shortest path in a unidirectional graph representation of the network.

If you want to change to bidirectional you can uncomment the entry in the ShortestPath.java file at
line 118

Due to the nature of this test I have made the decision to not use a JUnit TDD approach although 
I have put a single test in place which is basically just determining that it is not needed. More of a 
place holder to signify the approach I would take in a normal production development.

I hope that my assumption of it being more of an algorithm test is not incorrect.

Run the application and input information for start and end points when prompted in console.
